This study implements the integration of kinematics and discretization techniques to develop comprehensive mathematical models of robotic systems. Kinematics focuses on outlining the motion of points, bodies, and systems which is essential for robotic design and analysis. By applying discretization methods, continuous kinematic equations are transformed into their discrete counterparts. Synthesizing the counterparts into a discrete-time model facilitates better, more precise control of the robot. This strategy is utilized to model complex physical frameworks, such as robotic motion. Our project implements a simulation along with a related discrete-time model to display the precise position, orientation, and angular velocity of an autonomous driving car at discrete times. The resulting models demonstrate high accuracy and computational efficiency through precise simulations and predictions. The ultimate objective of this project is to successfully code an algorithm and a corresponding discrete-time model to be executed and run within the self-operating car to solve a preconfigured maze.
